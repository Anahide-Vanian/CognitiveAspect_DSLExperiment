//TASK 1: Sorting the objects

//OBJ1 And the robot "Robot" grabs the object "Piece"

Scenario: Grabbing the object 
Given the position of the robot "Robot" is "default"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "START_1"
Then the object "Piece" is grabbed

Scenario: Moving the object 
Given the object "Piece" is grabbed
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "SENSOR_AREA"
Then the object "Piece" is sensed

Scenario: Sorting the object its corresponding bucket
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "red"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "RED_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

Scenario: Sorting the object in its corresponding bucket
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "green"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "GREEN_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

Scenario: Sorting the object in its corresponding bucket
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "blue"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "BLUE_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

//OBJ2

Scenario: Grabbing the object
Given the position of the robot "Robot" is "default"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "START_2"
And the robot "Robot" grabs the object "Piece"
Then the object "Piece" is grabbed

Scenario: Placing the object in the correct bucket 
Given the object "Piece" is grabbed
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "SENSOR_AREA"
Then the object "Piece" is sensed

Scenario: Placing the object in the correct bucket 
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "red"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "RED_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

Scenario: Placing the object in the correct bucket 
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "green"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "GREEN_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

Scenario: Placing the object in the correct bucket 
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "blue"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "BLUE_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

//OBJ3

Scenario: Grabbing the object
Given the position of the robot "Robot" is "default"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "START_3"
And the robot "Robot" grabs the object "Piece"
Then the object "Piece" is grabbed

Scenario: Moving the object - detect its color
Given the object "Piece" is grabbed
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "SENSOR_AREA"
Then the object "Piece" is sensed

Scenario: Placing the object in the correct bucket 
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "red"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "RED_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

Scenario: Sorting the object in the correct bucket 
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "green"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "GREEN_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released

Scenario: Sorting the object in the correct bucket 
Given the color of the object "Piece" is "blue"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "BLUE_BUCKET_PLACE"
Then the object "Piece" is released


//TASK 2: Stacking the objects (red, blue, green order)

//RED

Scenario: Grabbing the object
Given the position of the robot "Robot" is "default"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "RED_BUCKET_PICK"
And the robot "Robot" grabs the object "Piece"
Then the object "Piece" is grabbed

Scenario: Stacking the RED object
Given the object "Piece" is grabbed
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "ASSEMBLING_AREA_1"
Then the object "Piece" is released

//BLUE

Scenario: Grabbing the object
Given the position of the robot "Robot" is "default"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "BLUE_BUCKET_PICK"
And the robot "Robot" grabs the object "Piece"
Then the object "Piece" is grabbed

Scenario: Stacking the BLUE object
Given the object "Piece" is grabbed
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "ASSEMBLING_AREA_2"
Then the object "Piece" is released

//GREEN
Scenario: Grabbing the object
Given the position of the robot "Robot" is "default"
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "GREEN_BUCKET_PICK"
And the robot "Robot" grabs the object "Piece"
Then the object "Piece" is grabbed

Scenario: Stacking the GREEN object
Given the object "Piece" is grabbed
When the robot "Robot" moves to position "ASSEMBLING_AREA_3"
Then the object "Piece" is released
